      <p>
        Hi, I'm Aditya Gupta — a passionate Full Stack Web Developer and a Computer Science student. I am also deeply interested in integrating AI solutions into my work, aiming to build smarter, more adaptive, and innovative web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey began in 2024, during my first year of college, when I took my first steps into web development. Now, in 2025, as a second-year student pursuing Software Engineering, I continue to build dynamic, user-friendly, and scalable web applications using modern technologies across both front-end and back-end stacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience blends hands-on development with a solid grounding in software engineering principles. Whether it's crafting responsive UIs with React, managing data with Node.js and MongoDB, or optimizing performance and functionality, I focus on creating solutions that are efficient, impactful, and scalable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas to stay ahead in this fast-evolving field. Recently, I've developed a strong interest in integrating artificial intelligence into web development — from smart chatbots to intelligent recommendation systems — and I’m excited to explore how AI can elevate the user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love turning ideas into real-world digital experiences that are both innovative and future-ready.
